      <h2>Introduction to Tarot</h2>
      <p>Tarot is a powerful tool for self-discovery, reflection, and gaining insight into life's questions. Originating in the 15th century as playing cards, Tarot has evolved into a sophisticated system of divination and personal growth used by millions worldwide.</p>
      <p>At its core, Tarot is a deck of 78 cards, each rich with symbolism and meaning. These cards are used to gain perspective on situations, explore possibilities, and tap into your intuition. Whether you're facing a specific dilemma or simply seeking guidance, Tarot can offer clarity and direction.</p>

      <h2>The Structure of a Tarot Deck</h2>
      <p>A traditional Tarot deck consists of two main parts:</p>
      
      <h3>The Major Arcana</h3>
      <p>The Major Arcana comprises 22 cards representing significant life events, spiritual lessons, and archetypal energies. These cards depict powerful symbols like The Fool, The Magician, The High Priestess, and The World. When they appear in a reading, they often indicate major influences or turning points in your life journey.</p>
      
      <h3>The Minor Arcana</h3>
      <p>The Minor Arcana consists of 56 cards divided into four suits: Wands, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles. Each suit corresponds to different aspects of life:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wands:</strong> Creativity, passion, inspiration, and action</li>
        <li><strong>Cups:</strong> Emotions, relationships, intuition, and the subconscious</li>
        <li><strong>Swords:</strong> Intellect, communication, conflict, and challenges</li>
        <li><strong>Pentacles:</strong> Material world, finances, career, and physical health</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Tarot Readings Work</h2>
      <p>A Tarot reading involves selecting cards and interpreting their meanings in relation to your question or situation. The position of each card in a spread (layout) adds layers of meaning to the interpretation.</p>
      <p>While some view Tarot as a way to predict the future, many practitioners see it as a tool for self-reflection and decision-making. The cards don't dictate your future but rather illuminate possibilities and help you access your inner wisdom.</p>
      <p>Modern Tarot readings often incorporate intuitive interpretation, where the reader considers not only traditional meanings but also their immediate impressions and the specific context of the querent's question.</p>
